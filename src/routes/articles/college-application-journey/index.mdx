## Preface: The application system is broken.

If you haven't had the chance to yet, I highly recommend you watch the video [The Problem With Applying to College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bDFSgl8mpQ) 
by Quinn Henry. It's a thorough review of the entire application process & how it's inherent flaws. Although initiatives such as Questbridge exist to 
target this disparities in income, opportunity, etc., for the vast majority of CS applicants
getting into an Ivy League/Ivy+ School is essentially a lottery. I believe my own case reflects this.

## The Schools I Applied to & My Stats

All in all, I applied to 18 total schools— 2 safeties and 16 reaches. I was rejected from 14 of them.

Here are the schools I applied to and their decisions:

I applied with the following stats: Rank 4 of 743, a 35 ACT (equivalent to a 1560-1590 SAT), and a 4.5 Weighted GPA. 

Nowadays, these are very average stats for a CS applicant. Most competitive applicants will be from the top 
5% of their class with a 33+/1500+, and none of these metrics will singlehandedly get you in to a top 10 CS school.
[Admitium](https://admitium.com/lessons/masterclass-5-common-application-activities-how-to-write-winning-titles-and-descriptions/) 
phrases it perfectly: <b>"Stats matter less than you think but more than you want them to."</b> (Check out his masterclass- it's seriously some 
of the best admissions info out there for $200.)

Ultimately, I like to think that such stats only qualify you to be considered as a candidate; anything after that is essentially luck of the draw.
Essays, extracurriculars, legacy connections, ethnicity, etc.— there are a million different factors that can influence your decision. 

Knowing this (and knowing that I'd be getting no preferential treatement based off my background), my strategy was to be as bold as possible with my essays.
Whether or not this was successful, I'm not sure myself— I still have no clue what pushed my application over the edge. Keep reading to take a look at the
essays that worked for me. :)

## The Insanity of UTCS's Competitiveness

Take a look at the following graph of UTCS's declining acceptance rate over the years:

<img src="/acceptanceRate.png" style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} />

It wouldn't be a stretch to assume that in 2024, there may have been anywhere between 12,000-15,000 applicants for around 600 seats.
Given these estimations, the acceptance rate falls between 3-5%. 

UTCS's [Turing Program](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) is even harder to get into. Out of the 500-600 admitted students, only 50 are offered
a spot in Turing honors. I was first deferred then rejected from Turing. 

From [texadmissions.com](https://texadmissions.com/blog/2018/5/16/ut-austin-computer-science-acceptance-rate-and-application-tips#:~:text=It's%20safe%20to%20assume%20that,Computer%20Science%20is%20ridiculously%20difficult.):

"A Turing admitted student reported that in their welcome orientation session, Turing staff said they admitted only 14 out of 80 valedictorians (82% denied)."

However, given that UT Austin is ranked #7 in CS, it's reasonable to expect such competitiveness in comparison to other schools.
